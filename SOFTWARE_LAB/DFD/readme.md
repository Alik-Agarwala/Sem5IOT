# Setting Up StarUML

1. Download <s>Star Jalsha</s> StarUML from this [link](https://staruml.io/) and install it.
2. Open up StarUML
3. Go to Model -> Add Diagram -> Dataflow Diagram
4. Data Flow will appear in your toolbox
5. Drag and Drop elements from the toolbar to construct your DFD

### P.S. Do not copy the .mdj files, they are meant for opening through the StarUML app.
