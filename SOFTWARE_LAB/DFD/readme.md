# Setting Up StarUML

1. Download <s>Star Jalsha</s> StarUML from this [link](https://staruml.io/) and install it.
2. Open up StarUML.
3. Go to Model -> Add Diagram -> Dataflow Diagram.
4. Data Flow will appear in your toolbox.
5. Drag and Drop elements from the toolbox to construct your DFD.

## <s>Note: You are advised to make your own DFD for library system, the one here should be used just as an example.</s> 

### P.S. Do not copy the .mdj files, they are meant for opening through the StarUML app.
